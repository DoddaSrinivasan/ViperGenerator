Demo for creating Viper Template
When you decide to use VIPER architecture in your project, it is very tired create new modules, because you need create at least 5 files for each. Imagine that you need to create 6 modules...I was suffering this problem, and this is the raison why I've created this template. It's very useful for me and I hope that for you too.

## How to install

### Using script (easy)
Only need execute this command in terminal:
```swift
sudo swift install.swift
```
You should be this output message:

âœ…  Template installed succesfully ðŸŽ‰. Enjoy it ðŸ™‚

If all it's ok you now could find your template in Xcode.

### Manual
Go to Application folder, browse to the Xcode application icon. Right-click it and choose 'Show Package Contents'. Then browse to:
`Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/iOS/Application` and add "Module VIPER.xctemplate" file. Now you can find your template in Xcode.
